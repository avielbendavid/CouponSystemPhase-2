Hello Eldar , 

there is few comments for your information :

   1.   I used in this project the interface : CommandLineRunner --> the work with this 
        interface is in the package [ coupon.system.operations.after.system.boot ]. 
   
   2.   I used in this project several configuration files - 
        I just wanted to learn how to work with several configuration properties files.  
        folder [ src/main/resources ].
        
   3.   I used the MySQL server in this project.
   
   4.   finally I create a unique service for the 'DailyJob' instead of the @Transactional annotation
        on the repository method.
